Yooooo! Welcome to the Nerd Clown Blog.

## How "Nerd Clown" Became a Thing

Someone asked my daughter what her dad does for work. Without hesitation, she said: "He's a nerd clown."

I mean...she's right.

My actual job title is Developer Educator at [Cloudflare](https://workers.cloudflare.com). I spend my days creating tutorials, writing documentation, recording videos, and finding ways to explain complex technical concepts so they actually make sense. I get genuinely excited about APIs, agents, and how the web works. And yes, I do tend to wave my hands around a lot when explaining things.

Building is fun, learning it should be too.

## What to Expect Here

This blog is where I'll share things I'm learning, building, and thinking about. The posts will be technical, but I'll try to keep them approachable and (dare I say) fun.

I'll get philosophical if I want to, it's my blog. (I think that's what you are supposed to sound like when you have one)

Topics you're gonna see:
- **AI** - I lean in hard, sorry/not sorry
- **Cloudflare Workers** - Y'all they rule, and it's the label that pays me.
- **Web development** - Frameworks, whozits, and whatnots
- **Developer tools** - Let's make our lives easier

## The Tech Stack

Since you're prolly curious (this is a tech blog after all):

- **Framework:** [Astro](https://astro.build) - Fast, content-focused, and a joy to work with
- **Hosting:** [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com) - Of course. Y'all it's free. C'mon
- **Style:** Custom CSS with a dark theme - Retro vibes with visible borders because I have opinions (well actually I used a skill that had opinions)

The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/craigsdennis/blog-nerdclown) if you want to poke around.

## Let's Go

I've been creating educational content for decades. But this space might be a little different. A little more weird, joyful, and third thing. Nerd out and clown around with me.

Thanks for hanging out, and we'll see you real soon.
