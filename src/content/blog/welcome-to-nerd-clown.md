Yooooo! So here we are. Another tech blog on the Internet. But this one has a story.

## How "Nerd Clown" Became a Thing

A few weeks ago, someone asked my daughter what her dad does for work. Without hesitation, she said: "He's a nerd clown."

I wasn't even mad. She's right.

My actual job title is Developer Educator at Cloudflare. I spend my days creating tutorials, writing documentation, recording videos, and finding ways to explain complex technical concepts so they actually make sense. I get genuinely excited about APIs, edge computing, and how the web works. And yes, I do tend to wave my hands around a lot when explaining things.

Nerd? Absolutely. Clown? Maybe a little.

## What to Expect Here

This blog is where I'll share things I'm learning, building, and thinking about. The posts will be technical, but I'll try to keep them approachable and (dare I say) fun.

Topics you might see:
- **Cloudflare Workers and edge computing** - It's what I do all day
- **Web development** - APIs, frameworks, the usual suspects
- **AI and machine learning** - It's impossible to ignore, might as well understand it
- **Developer tools** - Things that make building stuff easier
- **Random projects** - Whatever catches my interest

## The Tech Stack

Since you're probably curious (this is a tech blog after all):

- **Framework:** [Astro](https://astro.build) - Fast, content-focused, and a joy to work with
- **Hosting:** [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) - Of course
- **Style:** Custom CSS with a dark theme - Retro vibes with visible borders because I have opinions

The code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/craigsdennis) if you want to poke around.

## Let's Go

I've been creating educational content for years, but this space is mine. No style guides, no brand requirements, just me explaining things the way I want to explain them.

Thanks for stopping by. Let's learn some stuff together.
